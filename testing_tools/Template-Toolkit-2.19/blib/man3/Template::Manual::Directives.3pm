.IX Subsection "Accessing and Updating Template Variables"
.IP "\s-1GET\s0" 4
.IX Item "GET"
The \s-1GET\s0 directive retrieves and outputs the value of the named variable.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% GET foo %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1GET\s0 keyword is optional.  A variable can be specified in a directive
tag by itself.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% foo %]
.Ve
.Sp
The variable can have an unlimited number of elements, each separated
by a dot '.'.  Each element can have arguments specified within
parentheses.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% foo %]
\&    [% bar.baz %]
\&    [% biz.baz(10) %]
\&    ...etc...
.Ve
.Sp
See Template::Manual::Variables for a full discussion on template
variables.
.Sp
You can also specify expressions using the logical (and, or, not, ?:) and
mathematic operators (+ \- * / % mod div).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% template.title or default.title %]
\&
\&    [% score * 100 %]
\&
\&    [% order.nitems ? checkout(order.total) : 'no items' %]
.Ve
.Sp
The 'div' operator returns the integer result of division.  Both '%' and 
\&'mod' return the modulus (i.e. remainder) of division.  'mod' is provided
as an alias for '%' for backwards compatibility with version 1.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% 15 / 6 %]            # 2.5
\&    [% 15 div 6 %]          # 2
\&    [% 15 mod 6 %]          # 3
.Ve
.IP "\s-1CALL\s0" 4
.IX Item "CALL"
The \s-1CALL\s0 directive is similar to \s-1GET\s0 in evaluating the variable named,
but doesn't print the result returned.  This can be useful when a
variable is bound to a sub-routine or object method which you want to
call but aren't interested in the value returned.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% CALL dbi.disconnect %]
\&
\&    [% CALL inc_page_counter(page_count) %]
.Ve
.IP "\s-1SET\s0" 4
.IX Item "SET"
The \s-1SET\s0 directive allows you to assign new values to existing variables
or create new temporary variables.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% SET title = 'Hello World' %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1SET\s0 keyword is also optional.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% title = 'Hello World' %]
.Ve
.Sp
Variables may be assigned the values of other variables, unquoted
numbers (digits), literal text ('single quotes') or quoted text
(\*(L"double quotes\*(R").  In the latter case, any variable references within
the text will be interpolated when the string is evaluated.  Variables
should be prefixed by '$', using curly braces to explicitly scope
the variable name where necessary.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% foo  = 'Foo'  %]               # literal value 'Foo'
\&    [% bar  =  foo   %]               # value of variable 'foo'
\&    [% cost = '$100' %]               # literal value '$100'
\&    [% item = "$bar: ${cost}.00" %]   # value "Foo: $100.00"
.Ve
.Sp
Multiple variables may be assigned in the same directive and are 
evaluated in the order specified.  Thus, the above could have been 
written:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    [% foo  = 'Foo'
\&       bar  = foo
\&       cost = '$100'
\&       item = "$bar: ${cost}.00"
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
Simple expressions can also be used, as per \s-1GET\s0.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    [% ten    = 10 
\&       twenty = 20
\&       thirty = twenty + ten
\&       forty  = 2 * twenty 
\&       fifty  = 100 div 2
\&       six    = twenty mod 7
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
You can concatenate strings together using the ' _ ' operator.  In Perl 5,
the '.' is used for string concatenation, but in Perl 6, as in the Template
Toolkit, the '.' will be used as the method calling operator and ' _ ' will
be used for string concatenation.  Note that the operator must be 
specified with surrounding whitespace which, as Larry says, is construed as
a feature:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% copyright = '(C) Copyright' _ year _ ' ' _ author %]
.Ve
.Sp
You can, of course, achieve a similar effect with double quoted string 
interpolation.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% copyright = "(C) Copyright $year $author" %]
.Ve
.IP "\s-1DEFAULT\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT"
The \s-1DEFAULT\s0 directive is similar to \s-1SET\s0 but only updates variables 
that are currently undefined or have no \*(L"true\*(R" value (in the Perl
sense).
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% DEFAULT
\&       name = 'John Doe'
\&       id   = 'jdoe'
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
This can be particularly useful in common template components to
ensure that some sensible default are provided for otherwise 
undefined variables.
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    [% DEFAULT 
\&       title = 'Hello World'
\&       bgcol = '#ffffff'
\&    %]
\&    <html>
\&    <head>
\&    <title>[% title %]</title>
\&    </head>
\&
\&    <body bgcolor="[% bgcol %]">
.Ve
.Sh "Processing Other Template Files and Blocks"
.IX Subsection "Processing Other Template Files and Blocks"
.IP "\s-1INSERT\s0" 4
.IX Item "INSERT"
The \s-1INSERT\s0 directive is used to insert the contents of an external file
at the current position.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INSERT myfile %]
.Ve
.Sp
No attempt to parse or process the file is made.  The contents,
possibly including any embedded template directives, are inserted
intact.
.Sp
The filename specified should be relative to one of the \s-1INCLUDE_PATH\s0
directories.  Absolute (i.e. starting with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) and relative
(i.e. starting with \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) filenames may be used if the \s-1ABSOLUTE\s0 and
\&\s-1RELATIVE\s0 options are set, respectively.  Both these options are
disabled by default.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $template = Template\->new({
\&        INCLUDE_PATH => '/here:/there',
\&    });
\&
\&    $template\->process('myfile');
.Ve
.Sp
\&'myfile':
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% INSERT foo %]            # looks for /here/foo then /there/foo
\&    [% INSERT /etc/passwd %]    # file error: ABSOLUTE not set
\&    [% INSERT ../secret %]      # file error: RELATIVE not set
.Ve
.Sp
For convenience, the filename does not need to be quoted as long as it
contains only alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots or forward
slashes.  Names containing any other characters should be quoted.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% INSERT misc/legalese.txt            %]
\&    [% INSERT 'dos98/Program Files/stupid' %]
.Ve
.Sp
To evaluate a variable to specify a filename, you should explicitly
prefix it with a '$' or use double-quoted string interpolation.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% language = 'en'
\&       legalese = 'misc/legalese.txt' 
\&    %]
\&
\&    [% INSERT $legalese %]              # 'misc/legalese.txt'
\&    [% INSERT "$language/$legalese" %]  # 'en/misc/legalese.txt'
.Ve
.Sp
Multiple files can be specified using '+' as a delimiter.  All files
should be unquoted names or quoted strings.  Any variables should be
interpolated into double-quoted strings.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% INSERT legalese.txt + warning.txt %]
\&    [% INSERT  "$legalese" + warning.txt %]  # requires quoting
.Ve
.IP "\s-1INCLUDE\s0" 4
.IX Item "INCLUDE"
The \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive is used to process and include the output of
another template file or block.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE header %]
.Ve
.Sp
If a \s-1BLOCK\s0 of the specified name is defined in the same file, or in a file 
from which the current template has been called (i.e. a parent template) 
then it will be used in preference to any file of the same name.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE table %]             # uses BLOCK defined below
\&
\&    [% BLOCK table %]
\&       <table>
\&       ...
\&       </table>
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
If a \s-1BLOCK\s0 definition is not currently visible then the template name
should be a file relative to one of the \s-1INCLUDE_PATH\s0 directories, or
an absolute or relative file name if the \s-1ABSOLUTE/RELATIVE\s0 options are
appropriately enabled.  The \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive automatically quotes the
filename specified, as per \s-1INSERT\s0 described above.  When a variable
contains the name of the template for the \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive, it should
be explicitly prefixed by '$' or double-quoted
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% myheader = 'my/misc/header' %]
\&    [% INCLUDE   myheader  %]            # 'myheader'
\&    [% INCLUDE  $myheader  %]            # 'my/misc/header'
\&    [% INCLUDE "$myheader" %]            # 'my/misc/header'
.Ve
.Sp
Any template directives embedded within the file will be processed
accordingly.  All variables currently defined will be visible and 
accessible from within the included template.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% title = 'Hello World' %]
\&    [% INCLUDE header %]
\&    <body>
\&    ...
.Ve
.Sp
\&'header':
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <html>
\&    <title>[% title %]</title>
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    <html>
\&    <title>Hello World</title>
\&    <body>
\&    ...
.Ve
.Sp
Local variable definitions may be specified after the template name,
temporarily masking any existing variables.  Insignificant whitespace
is ignored within directives so you can add variable definitions on the
same line, the next line or split across several line with comments
interspersed, if you prefer.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE table %]
\&
\&    [% INCLUDE table title="Active Projects" %]
\&
\&    [% INCLUDE table 
\&         title   = "Active Projects" 
\&         bgcolor = "#80ff00"    # chartreuse
\&         border  = 2
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive localises (i.e. copies) all variables before
processing the template.  Any changes made within the included
template will not affect variables in the including template.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% foo = 10 %]
\&
\&    foo is originally [% foo %]
\&    [% INCLUDE bar %]
\&    foo is still [% foo %]
\&
\&    [% BLOCK bar %]
\&       foo was [% foo %]
\&       [% foo = 20 %]
\&       foo is now [% foo %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
    foo is originally 10
       foo was 10
       foo is now 20
    foo is still 10
.Sp
Technical Note: the localisation of the stash (that is, the process by
which variables are copied before an \s-1INCLUDE\s0 to prevent being
overwritten) is only skin deep.  The top-level variable namespace
(hash) is copied, but no attempt is made to perform a deep-copy of
other structures (hashes, arrays, objects, etc.)  Therefore, a 'foo'
variable referencing a hash will be copied to create a new 'foo'
variable but which points to the same hash array.  Thus, if you update
compound variables (e.g. foo.bar) then you will change the original
copy, regardless of any stash localisation.  If you're not worried
about preserving variable values, or you trust the templates you're
including then you might prefer to use the \s-1PROCESS\s0 directive which is
faster by virtue of not performing any localisation.
.Sp
From version 2.04 onwards, you can specify dotted variables as \*(L"local\*(R"
variables to an \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive.  However, be aware that because of
the localisation issues explained above (if you skipped the previous
Technical Note above then you might want to go back and read it or
skip this section too), the variables might not actualy be \*(L"local\*(R".
If the first element of the variable name already references a hash
array then the variable update will affect the original variable.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% foo = {
\&           bar = 'Baz'
\&       }
\&    %]
\&  
\&    [% INCLUDE somefile foo.bar='Boz' %]
\&
\&    [% foo.bar %]           # Boz
.Ve
.Sp
This behaviour can be a little unpredictable (and may well be improved
upon in a future version).  If you know what you're doing with it and 
you're sure that the variables in question are defined (nor not) as you 
expect them to be, then you can rely on this feature to implement some
powerful \*(L"global\*(R" data sharing techniques.  Otherwise, you might prefer
to steer well clear and always pass simple (undotted) variables as 
parameters to \s-1INCLUDE\s0 and other similar directives.
.Sp
If you want to process several templates in one go then you can 
specify each of their names (quoted or unquoted names only, no unquoted
\&'$variables') joined together by '+'.  The \s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive
will then process them in order.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% INCLUDE html/header + "site/$header" + site/menu
\&         title = "My Groovy Web Site"
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
The variable stash is localised once and then the templates specified
are processed in order, all within that same variable context.  This
makes it slightly faster than specifying several separate \s-1INCLUDE\s0
directives (because you only clone the variable stash once instead of
n times), but not quite as \*(L"safe\*(R" because any variable changes in the
first file will be visible in the second, third and so on.  This
might be what you want, of course, but then again, it might not.
.IP "\s-1PROCESS\s0" 4
.IX Item "PROCESS"
The \s-1PROCESS\s0 directive is similar to \s-1INCLUDE\s0 but does not perform any 
localisation of variables before processing the template.  Any changes
made to variables within the included template will be visible in the
including template.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% foo = 10 %]
\&
\&    foo is [% foo %]
\&    [% PROCESS bar %]
\&    foo is [% foo %]
\&
\&    [% BLOCK bar %]
\&       [% foo = 20 %]
\&       changed foo to [% foo %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foo is 10
\&       changed foo to 20
\&    foo is 20
.Ve
.Sp
Parameters may be specified in the \s-1PROCESS\s0 directive, but these too will 
become visible changes to current variable values.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% foo = 10 %]
\&    foo is [% foo %]
\&    [% PROCESS bar
\&       foo = 20 
\&    %]
\&    foo is [% foo %]
\&
\&    [% BLOCK bar %]
\&       this is bar, foo is [% foo %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foo is 10
\&       this is bar, foo is 20
\&    foo is 20
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1PROCESS\s0 directive is slightly faster than \s-1INCLUDE\s0 because it
avoids the need to localise (i.e. copy) the variable stash before
processing the template.  As with \s-1INSERT\s0 and \s-1INCLUDE\s0, the first
parameter does not need to be quoted as long as it contains only
alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods or forward slashes.
A '$' prefix can be used to explicitly indicate a variable which 
should be interpolated to provide the template name:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% myheader = 'my/misc/header' %]
\&    [% PROCESS  myheader %]              # 'myheader'
\&    [% PROCESS $myheader %]              # 'my/misc/header'
.Ve
.Sp
As with \s-1INCLUDE\s0, multiple templates can be specified, delimited by
\&'+', and are processed in order.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% PROCESS html/header + my/header %]
.Ve
.IP "\s-1WRAPPER\s0" 4
.IX Item "WRAPPER"
It's not unusual to find yourself adding common headers and footers to 
pages or sub-sections within a page.  Something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% INCLUDE section/header
\&       title = 'Quantum Mechanics'
\&    %]
\&       Quantum mechanics is a very interesting subject wish 
\&       should prove easy for the layman to fully comprehend.
\&    [% INCLUDE section/footer %]
\&
\&    [% INCLUDE section/header
\&       title = 'Desktop Nuclear Fusion for under $50'
\&    %]
\&       This describes a simple device which generates significant 
\&       sustainable electrical power from common tap water by process 
\&       of nuclear fusion.
\&    [% INCLUDE section/footer %]
.Ve
.Sp
The individual template components being included might look like these:
.Sp
section/header:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <p>
\&    <h2>[% title %]</h2>
.Ve
.Sp
section/footer:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    </p>
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1WRAPPER\s0 directive provides a way of simplifying this a little.  It
encloses a block up to a matching \s-1END\s0 directive, which is first
processed to generate some output.  This is then passed to the named
template file or \s-1BLOCK\s0 as the 'content' variable.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% WRAPPER section
\&       title = 'Quantum Mechanics'
\&    %]
\&       Quantum mechanics is a very interesting subject wish 
\&       should prove easy for the layman to fully comprehend.
\&    [% END %]
\&
\&    [% WRAPPER section

The single 'section' template can then be defined as:

Like other block directives, it can be used in side-effect notation:

.Sp
It's also possible to specify multiple templates to a \s-1WRAPPER\s0 directive.
The specification order indicates outermost to innermost wrapper templates.
For example, given the following template block definitions:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% BLOCK bold   %]<b>[% content %]</b>[% END %]

.Ve

the directive
.Sp
.Vb 1

The \s-1BLOCK\s0 ... \s-1END\s0 construct can be used to define template component
blocks which can be processed with the \s-1INCLUDE\s0, \s-1PROCESS\s0 and \s-1WRAPPER\s0

A \s-1BLOCK\s0 definition can be used before it is defined, as long as the
definition resides in the same file.  The block definition itself does
not generate any output.

You can use an anonymous \s-1BLOCK\s0 to capture the output of a template

.Ve
.Sp
Like a named block, it can contain any other template directives which 
are processed when the block is defined.  The output generated by the 
block is then assigned to the variable 'julius'.

Anonymous BLOCKs can also be used to define block macros.  The
enclosing block is processed each time the macro is called.

of \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR for \f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, and so on.  That means that \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`not\*(C'\fR

The \s-1SWITCH\s0 / \s-1CASE\s0 construct can be used to perform a multi-way

first evaluated and then compared against each \s-1CASE\s0 statement in turn.
Each \s-1CASE\s0 directive should contain a single value or a list of values
which should match.  \s-1CASE\s0 may also be left blank or written as [% \s-1CASE\s0

When the \s-1FOREACH\s0 directive is used without specifying a target variable, 
any iterated values which are hash references will be automatically 
imported.

.Sp
Note that this particular usage creates a localised variable context
to prevent the imported hash keys from overwriting any existing
variables.  The imported definitions and any other variables defined
in such a \s-1FOREACH\s0 loop will be lost at the end of the loop, when the 
previous context and variable values are restored.
.Sp
However, under normal operation, the loop variable remains in scope
after the \s-1FOREACH\s0 loop has ended (caveat: overwriting any variable
previously in scope). This is useful as the loop variable is secretly
an iterator object (see below) and can be used to analyse the last
entry processed by the loop.
.Sp
The \s-1FOREACH\s0 directive can also be used to iterate through the entries
in a hash array.  Each entry in the hash is returned in sorted order
(based on the key) as a hash array containing 'key' and 'value' items.
.Sp

The \s-1FOREACH\s0 directive is implemented using the Template::Iterator

can be called on the 'loop' iterator.
.Sp

\&    count()     iteration counter from 1 to size() (i.e. index() + 1)
\&    first()     true if the current iteration is the first
\&    last()      true if the current iteration is the last

Nested loops will work as expected, with the 'loop' variable correctly 
referencing the innermost loop and being restored to any previous 
value (i.e. an outer loop) at the end of the loop.

.Ve
.Sp
The 'iterator' plugin can also be used to explicitly create an
iterator object.  This can be useful within nested loops where you
need to keep a reference to the outer iterator within the inner loop.
The iterator plugin effectively allows you to create an iterator by a
name other than 'loop'.  See Template::Plugin::Iterator for further
details.

.Sp
The Template Toolkit uses a failsafe counter to prevent runaway \s-1WHILE\s0
loops which would otherwise never terminate.  If the loop exceeds 1000
iterations then an 'undef' exception will be thrown, reporting the
error:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "\s-1FILTER\s0" 4
.IX Item "FILTER"
The \s-1FILTER\s0 directive can be used to post-process the output of a
block.  A number of standard filters are provided with the Template
Toolkit.  The 'html' filter, for example, escapes the '<', '>'
and '&' characters to prevent them from being interpreted as \s-1HTML\s0 tags
or entity reference markers.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% FILTER html %]
\&       HTML text may have < and > characters embedded
\&       which you want converted to the correct HTML entities.

\&       HTML text may have &lt; and &gt; characters embedded
\&       which you want converted to the correct HTML entities.

The \s-1FILTER\s0 directive can also follow various other non-block directives.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE mytext FILTER html %]
.Ve
.Sp
The '|' character can also be used as an alias for '\s-1FILTER\s0'.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE mytext | html %]
.Ve

Multiple filters can be chained together and will be called in sequence.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE mytext FILTER html FILTER html_para %]
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE mytext | html | html_para %]
.Ve
.Sp
Filters come in two flavours, known as 'static' or 'dynamic'.  A
static filter is a simple subroutine which accepts a text string as
the only argument and returns the modified text.  The 'html' filter is
an example of a static filter, implemented as:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    sub html_filter {
\&        my $text = shift;
\&        for ($text) {
\&            s/&/&amp;/g;
\&            s/</&lt;/g;
\&            s/>/&gt;/g;
\&        }
\&        return $text;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Dynamic filters can accept arguments which are specified when the filter
is called from a template.  The 'repeat' filter is such an example, 
accepting a numerical argument which specifies the number of times
that the input text should be repeated.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% FILTER repeat(3) %]blah [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    blah blah blah
.Ve
.Sp
These are implemented as filter 'factories'.  The factory subroutine
is passed a reference to the current Template::Context object along
with any additional arguments specified.  It should then return a
subroutine reference (e.g. a closure) which implements the filter.
The 'repeat' filter factory is implemented like this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    sub repeat_filter_factory {
\&        my ($context, $iter) = @_;
\&        $iter = 1 unless defined $iter;
\&
\&        return sub {
\&            my $text = shift;
\&            $text = '' unless defined $text;
\&            return join('\en', $text) x $iter;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1FILTERS\s0 option, described in Template::Manual::Config, allows 
custom filters to be defined when a Template object is instantiated.  
The Template::Context \fIdefine_filter()\fR method allows further filters
to be defined at any time.
.Sp
When using a filter, it is possible to assign an alias to it for 
further use.  This is most useful for dynamic filters that you want 
to re-use with the same configuration.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% FILTER echo = repeat(2) %]
\&    Is there anybody out there?
\&    [% END %]
\&
\&    [% FILTER echo %]
\&    Mother, should I build a wall?
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Output:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    Is there anybody out there?
\&    Is there anybody out there?
\&
\&    Mother, should I build a wall?
\&    Mother, should I build a wall?
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1FILTER\s0 directive automatically quotes the name of the filter.  As
with \s-1INCLUDE\s0 et al, you can use a variable to provide the name of the 
filter, prefixed by '$'.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% myfilter = 'html' %]
\&    [% FILTER $myfilter %]      # same as [% FILTER html %]
\&       ...
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
A template variable can also be used to define a static filter
subroutine.  However, the Template Toolkit will automatically call any
subroutine bound to a variable and use the value returned.  Thus, the
above example could be implemented as:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $vars = {
\&        myfilter => sub { return 'html' },
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
template:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% FILTER $myfilter %]      # same as [% FILTER html %]
\&       ...
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
To define a template variable that evaluates to a subroutine reference
that can be used by the \s-1FILTER\s0 directive, you should create a
subroutine that, when called automatically by the Template Toolkit,
returns another subroutine reference which can then be used to perform
the filter operation.  Note that only static filters can be
implemented in this way.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $vars = {
\&        myfilter => sub { \e&my_filter_sub },
\&    };
\&
\&    sub my_filter_sub {
\&        my $text = shift;
\&        # do something
\&        return $text;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
template:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% FILTER $myfilter %]
\&       ...
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Alternately, you can bless a subroutine reference into a class (any
class will do) to fool the Template Toolkit into thinking it's an
object rather than a subroutine.  This will then bypass the automatic
\&\*(L"call-a-subroutine-to-return-a-value\*(R" magic.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $vars = {
\&        myfilter => bless(\e&my_filter_sub, 'anything_you_like'),
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
template:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% FILTER $myfilter %]          
\&       ...
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Filters bound to template variables remain local to the variable
context in which they are defined.  That is, if you define a filter in
a \s-1PERL\s0 block within a template that is loaded via \s-1INCLUDE\s0, then the
filter definition will only exist until the end of that template when
the stash is delocalised, restoring the previous variable state.  If
you want to define a filter which persists for the lifetime of the
processor, or define additional dynamic filter factories, then you can
call the \fIdefine_filter()\fR method on the current Template::Context
object.
.Sp
See Template::Manual::Filters for a complete list of available filters,
their descriptions and examples of use.
.IP "\s-1USE\s0" 4

A plugin is a regular Perl module that conforms to a particular
object-oriented interface, allowing it to be loaded into and used
automatically by the Template Toolkit.  For details of this interface
and information on writing plugins, consult Template::Plugin.

A number of standard plugins are included with the Template Toolkit

standard plugins are case insensitive.

\&        },
\&    });
.Ve
.Sp
The recommended convention is to specify these plugin names in lower
case.  The Template Toolkit first looks for an exact case-sensitive
match and then tries the lower case conversion of the name specified.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE Foo %]      # look for 'Foo' then 'foo'
.Ve
.Sp
If you define all your \s-1PLUGINS\s0 with lower case names then they will be
located regardless of how the user specifies the name in the \s-1USE\s0
directive.  If, on the other hand, you define your \s-1PLUGINS\s0 with upper
or mixed case names then the name specified in the \s-1USE\s0 directive must
match the case exactly.
.Sp
If the plugin isn't defined in either the standard plugins
($Template::Plugins::STD_PLUGINS) or via the \s-1PLUGINS\s0 option, then 
the \s-1PLUGIN_BASE\s0 is searched.
.Sp
In this case the plugin name \fIis\fR case-sensitive.  It is appended to
each of the \s-1PLUGIN_BASE\s0 module namespaces in turn (default:
\&'Template::Plugin') to construct a full module name which it attempts
to locate and load.  Any periods, '.', in the name will be converted
to '::'.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% USE MyPlugin %]     #  => Template::Plugin::MyPlugin
\&    [% USE Foo.Bar  %]     #  => Template::Plugin::Foo::Bar
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1LOAD_PERL\s0 option (disabled by default) provides a further way by
which external Perl modules may be loaded.  If a regular Perl module
(i.e. not a Template::Plugin::* or other module relative to some
\&\s-1PLUGIN_BASE\s0) supports an object-oriented interface and a \fInew()\fR
constructor then it can be loaded and instantiated automatically.  The
following trivial example shows how the IO::File module might be used.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE file = IO.File('/tmp/mydata') %]
\&
\&    [% WHILE (line = file.getline) %]
\&       <!\-\- [% line %] \-\->
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Any additional parameters supplied in parenthesis after the plugin
name will be also be passed to the \fInew()\fR constructor.  A reference to
the current Template::Context object is passed as the first
parameter.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE MyPlugin('foo', 123) %]
.Ve
.Sp
equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Template::Plugin::MyPlugin\->new($context, 'foo', 123);
.Ve
.Sp
The only exception to this is when a module is loaded via the
\&\s-1LOAD_PERL\s0 option.  In this case the \f(CW$context\fR reference is \fInot\fR
passed to the \fInew()\fR constructor.  This is based on the assumption that
the module is a regular Perl module rather than a Template Toolkit
plugin so isn't expecting a context reference and wouldn't know what
to do with it anyway.
.Sp
Named parameters may also be specified.  These are collated into a
hash which is passed by reference as the last parameter to the
constructor, as per the general code calling interface.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE url('/cgi\-bin/foo', mode='submit', debug=1) %]
.Ve
.Sp
equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    Template::Plugin::URL\->new($context, '/cgi\-bin/foo'
\&                               { mode => 'submit', debug => 1 });
.Ve
.Sp
The plugin may represent any data type; a simple variable, hash, list or
code reference, but in the general case it will be an object reference.
Methods can be called on the object (or the relevant members of the
specific data type) in the usual way:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE table(mydata, rows=3) %]
\&
\&    [% FOREACH row = table.rows %]
\&       <tr>    
\&       [% FOREACH item = row %]
\&          <td>[% item %]</td>
\&       [% END %]
\&       </tr>
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
An alternative name may be provided for the plugin by which it can be 
referenced:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE scores = table(myscores, cols=5) %]
\&
\&    [% FOREACH row = scores.rows %]
\&       ...
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
You can use this approach to create multiple plugin objects with
different configurations.  This example shows how the 'format' plugin
is used to create sub-routines bound to variables for formatting text
as per \fIprintf()\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% USE bold = format('<b>%s</b>') %]
\&    [% USE ital = format('<i>%s</i>') %]
\&
\&    [% bold('This is bold')   %]
\&    [% ital('This is italic') %]
.Ve
.Sp
Output:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <b>This is bold</b>
\&    <i>This is italic</i>
.Ve
.Sp
This next example shows how the \s-1URL\s0 plugin can be used to build
dynamic URLs from a base part and optional query parameters.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% USE mycgi = URL('/cgi\-bin/foo.pl', debug=1) %]
\&    <a href="[% mycgi %]">...
\&    <a href="[% mycgi(mode='submit') %]"...
.Ve
.Sp
Output:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <a href="/cgi\-bin/foo.pl?debug=1">...
\&    <a href="/cgi\-bin/foo.pl?mode=submit&debug=1">...

The \s-1CGI\s0 plugin is an example of one which delegates to another Perl
module.  In this this case, it is to Lincoln Stein's \s-1CGI\s0.pm module.
All of the methods provided by \s-1CGI\s0.pm are available via the plugin.
.Sp

Simon Matthews has written the \s-1DBI\s0 plugin which provides an interface
to Tim Bunce's \s-1DBI\s0 module (available from \s-1CPAN\s0).  Here's a short
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% USE DBI('DBI:mSQL:mydbname') %]
\&
\&    [% FOREACH user = DBI.query('SELECT * FROM users') %]
\&       [% user.id %] [% user.name %] [% user.etc.etc %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
See Template::Manual::Plugins for more information on the plugins
distributed with the toolkit or available from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.IP "\s-1MACRO\s0" 4
.IX Item "MACRO"
The \s-1MACRO\s0 directive allows you to define a directive or directive block
which is then evaluated each time the macro is called.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% MACRO header INCLUDE header %]
.Ve
.Sp
Calling the macro as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% header %]
.Ve
.Sp
is then equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE header %]
.Ve
.Sp
Macros can be passed named parameters when called.  These values remain 
local to the macro.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% header(title='Hello World') %]
.Ve
.Sp
equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% INCLUDE header title='Hello World' %]
.Ve
.Sp
A \s-1MACRO\s0 definition may include parameter names.  Values passed to the 
macros are then mapped to these local variables.  Other named parameters
may follow these.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% MACRO header(title) INCLUDE header %]
\&
\&    [% header('Hello World') %]
\&    [% header('Hello World', bgcol='#123456') %]
.Ve
.Sp
equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% INCLUDE header title='Hello World' %]
\&    [% INCLUDE header title='Hello World' bgcol='#123456' %]
.Ve
.Sp
Here's another example, defining a macro for display numbers
in comma-delimited groups of 3, using the chunk and join virtual
method.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% MACRO number(n) GET n.chunk(\-3).join(',') %]
\&
\&    [% number(1234567) %]    # 1,234,567
.Ve
.Sp
A \s-1MACRO\s0 may precede any directive and must conform to the structure 
of the directive.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    [% MACRO header IF frames %]
\&       [% INCLUDE frames/header %]
\&    [% ELSE %]
\&       [% INCLUDE header %]
\&    [% END %]
\&
\&    [% header %]
.Ve
.Sp
A \s-1MACRO\s0 may also be defined as an anonymous \s-1BLOCK\s0.  The block will be
evaluated each time the macro is called.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% MACRO header BLOCK %]
\&       ...content...
\&    [% END %]
\&
\&    [% header %]
.Ve
.Sp
If you've got the \s-1EVAL_PERL\s0 option set, then you can even define a
\&\s-1MACRO\s0 as a \s-1PERL\s0 block (see below):
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% MACRO triple(n) PERL %]
\&         my $n = $stash\->get('n');
\&         print $n * 3;

.Ve
.IP "\s-1PERL\s0" 4
.IX Item "PERL"
(for the advanced reader)
.Sp
The \s-1PERL\s0 directive is used to mark the start of a block which contains
Perl code for evaluation.  The \s-1EVAL_PERL\s0 option must be enabled for Perl
code to be evaluated or a 'perl' exception will be thrown with the 
message '\s-1EVAL_PERL\s0 not set'.
.Sp
Perl code is evaluated in the Template::Perl package.  The \f(CW$context\fR
package variable contains a reference to the current Template::Context
object.  This can be used to access the functionality of the Template
Toolkit to process other templates, load plugins, filters, etc.
See Template::Context for further details.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% PERL %]
\&       print $context\->include('myfile');
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW$stash\fR variable contains a reference to the top-level stash object
which manages template variables.  Through this, variable values can
be retrieved and updated.  See Template::Stash for further details.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% PERL %]
\&       $stash\->set(foo => 'bar');
\&       print "foo value: ", $stash\->get('foo');
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Output
    foo value: bar
.Sp
Output is generated from the \s-1PERL\s0 block by calling \fIprint()\fR.  Note that
the Template::Perl::PERLOUT handle is selected (tied to an output
buffer) instead of \s-1STDOUT\s0.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% PERL %]
\&       print "foo\en";                           # OK
\&       print PERLOUT "bar\en";                   # OK, same as above
\&       print Template::Perl::PERLOUT "baz\en";   # OK, same as above
\&       print STDOUT "qux\en";                    # WRONG!
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1PERL\s0 block may contain other template directives.  These are
processed before the Perl code is evaluated.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% name = 'Fred Smith' %]
\&
\&    [% PERL %]
\&       print "[% name %]\en";
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Thus, the Perl code in the above example is evaluated as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "Fred Smith\en";
.Ve
.Sp
Exceptions may be thrown from within \s-1PERL\s0 blocks via \fIdie()\fR and will be
correctly caught by enclosing \s-1TRY\s0 blocks.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       [% PERL %]

.IX Item "RAWPERL"
(for the very advanced reader)
.Sp
The Template Toolkit parser reads a source template and generates the
text of a Perl subroutine as output.  It then uses \fIeval()\fR to evaluate
it into a subroutine reference.  This subroutine is then called to
process the template, passing a reference to the current
Template::Context object through which the functionality of the
Template Toolkit can be accessed.  The subroutine reference can be
cached, allowing the template to be processed repeatedly without
requiring any further parsing.
.Sp
For example, a template such as:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    [% PROCESS header %]
\&    The [% animal %] sat on the [% location %]
\&    [% PROCESS footer %]
.Ve
.Sp
is converted into the following Perl subroutine definition:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub {
\&        my $context = shift;
\&        my $stash   = $context\->stash;
\&        my $output  = '';
\&        my $error;
\&        
\&        eval { BLOCK: {
\&            $output .=  $context\->process('header');
\&            $output .=  "The ";
\&            $output .=  $stash\->get('animal');
\&            $output .=  " sat on the ";
\&            $output .=  $stash\->get('location');
\&            $output .=  $context\->process('footer');
\&            $output .=  "\en";
\&        } };
\&        if ($@) {
\&            $error = $context\->catch($@, \e$output);
\&            die $error unless $error\->type eq 'return';
\&        }
\&    
\&        return $output;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
To examine the Perl code generated, such as in the above example, set
the \f(CW$Template::Parser::DEBUG\fR package variable to any true value.  You
can also set the \f(CW$Template::Directive::PRETTY\fR variable true to have
the code formatted in a readable manner for human consumption.  The
source code for each generated template subroutine will be printed to
\&\s-1STDERR\s0 on compilation (i.e. the first time a template is used).
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $Template::Parser::DEBUG = 1;
\&    $Template::Directive::PRETTY = 1;
\&
\&    ...
\&
\&    $template\->process($file, $vars)
\&        || die $template\->error(), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1PERL\s0 ... \s-1END\s0 construct allows Perl code to be embedded into a
template (when the \s-1EVAL_PERL\s0 option is set), but it is evaluated at
\&\*(L"runtime\*(R" using \fIeval()\fR each time the template subroutine is called.
This is inherently flexible, but not as efficient as it could be,
especially in a persistent server environment where a template may be
processed many times.
.Sp
The \s-1RAWPERL\s0 directive allows you to write Perl code that is integrated
directly into the generated Perl subroutine text.  It is evaluated
once at compile time and is stored in cached form as part of the
compiled template subroutine.  This makes \s-1RAWPERL\s0 blocks more
efficient than \s-1PERL\s0 blocks.
.Sp
The downside is that you must code much closer to the metal.  Within
\&\s-1PERL\s0 blocks, you can call \fIprint()\fR to generate some output.  \s-1RAWPERL\s0
blocks don't afford such luxury.  The code is inserted directly into
the generated subroutine text and should conform to the convention of
appending to the '$output' variable.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% PROCESS  header %]
\&
\&    [% RAWPERL %]
\&       $output .= "Some output\en";
\&       ...
\&       $output .= "Some more output\en";
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
The critical section of the generated subroutine for this example would 
then look something like:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    ...
\&    eval { BLOCK: {
\&        $output .=  $context\->process('header');
\&        $output .=  "\en";
\&        $output .= "Some output\en";
\&        ...
\&        $output .= "Some more output\en";
\&        $output .=  "\en";
\&    } };
\&    ...
.Ve
.Sp
As with \s-1PERL\s0 blocks, the \f(CW$context\fR and \f(CW$stash\fR references are pre-defined
and available for use within \s-1RAWPERL\s0 code.

The Template Toolkit supports fully functional, nested exception
handling.  The \s-1TRY\s0 directive introduces an exception handling scope 
which continues until the matching \s-1END\s0 directive.  Any errors that 
occur within that block will be caught and can be handled by one
of the \s-1CATCH\s0 blocks defined.
.Sp
.Vb 9

\&       An error occurred!
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Errors are raised as exceptions (objects of the Template::Exception 
class) and contain two fields, 'type' and 'info'.  The exception 
\&'type' can be any string containing letters, numbers, '_' or '.', and
is used to indicate the kind of error that occurred.  The 'info' field
contains an error message indicating what actually went wrong.  Within
a catch block, the exception object is aliased to the 'error' variable.
You can access the 'type' and 'info' fields directly.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    [% mydsn = 'dbi:MySQL:foobar' %]
\&    ...

The 'error' variable can also be specified by itself and will return a 
string of the form \*(L"$type error \- \f(CW$info\fR\*(R".

Each \s-1CATCH\s0 block may be specified with a particular exception type
denoting the kind of error that it should catch.  Multiple \s-1CATCH\s0
blocks can be provided to handle different types of exception that may
be thrown in the \s-1TRY\s0 block.  A \s-1CATCH\s0 block specified without any type,
as in the previous example, is a default handler which will catch any
otherwise uncaught exceptions.  This can also be specified as 
[% \s-1CATCH\s0 \s-1DEFAULT\s0 %].
.Sp

Remember that you can specify multiple directives within a single tag,
each delimited by ';'.  Thus, you might prefer to write your simple
\&\s-1CATCH\s0 blocks more succinctly as:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH file; "File Error! $error.info" %]
\&    [% CATCH DBI;  INCLUDE database/error.html %]
\&    [% CATCH; error %]
\&    [% END %]

or even:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH file ;
\&           "File Error! $error.info" ;
\&       CATCH DBI ;
\&           INCLUDE database/error.html ;

\&           error ;
\&       END
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1DBI\s0 plugin throws exceptions of the '\s-1DBI\s0' type (in case that
wasn't already obvious).  The other specific exception caught here is
of the 'file' type.
.Sp
A 'file' error is automatically thrown by the Template Toolkit when it
can't find a file, or fails to load, parse or process a file that has
been requested by an \s-1INCLUDE\s0, \s-1PROCESS\s0, \s-1INSERT\s0 or \s-1WRAPPER\s0 directive.
If 'myfile' can't be found in the example above, the [% \s-1INCLUDE\s0 myfile
%] directive will raise a 'file' exception which is then caught by the
[% \s-1CATCH\s0 file %] block, generating the output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    File Error! myfile: not found
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the \s-1DEFAULT\s0 option (disabled by default) allows you to
specify a default file to be used any time a template file can't be
found.  This will prevent file exceptions from ever being raised when
a non-existant file is requested (unless, of course, the \s-1DEFAULT\s0 file
doesn't exist).  Errors encountered once the file has been found
(i.e. read error, parse error) will be raised as file exceptions as per
usual.
.Sp
Uncaught exceptions (i.e. the \s-1TRY\s0 block doesn't have a type specific
or default \s-1CATCH\s0 handler) may be caught by enclosing \s-1TRY\s0 blocks which
can be nested indefinitely across multiple templates.  If the error
isn't caught at any level then processing will stop and the Template
\&\fIprocess()\fR method will return a false value to the caller.  The
relevant Template::Exception object can be retrieved by calling the
\&\fIerror()\fR method.
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&       [% TRY %]
\&          [% INCLUDE $user.header %]
\&       [% CATCH file %]
\&          [% INCLUDE header %]
\&       [% END %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH DBI %]
\&       [% INCLUDE database/error.html %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
In this example, the inner \s-1TRY\s0 block is used to ensure that the first
\&\s-1INCLUDE\s0 directive works as expected.  We're using a variable to
provide the name of the template we want to include, user.header, and
it's possible this contains the name of a non-existant template, or
perhaps one containing invalid template directives.  If the \s-1INCLUDE\s0 fails
 with a 'file' error then we \s-1CATCH\s0 it in the inner block and \s-1INCLUDE\s0
the default 'header' file instead.  Any \s-1DBI\s0 errors that occur within
the scope of the outer \s-1TRY\s0 block will be caught in the relevant \s-1CATCH\s0
block, causing the 'database/error.html' template to be processed.
Note that included templates inherit all currently defined template
variable so these error files can quite happily access the 'error'
variable to retrieve information about the currently caught exception.
e.g.
.Sp
\&'database/error.html':
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <h2>Database Error</h2>
\&    A database error has occurred: [% error.info %]
.Ve
.Sp
You can also specify a \s-1FINAL\s0 block.  This is always processed
regardless of the outcome of the \s-1TRY\s0 and/or \s-1CATCH\s0 block.  If an
exception is uncaught then the \s-1FINAL\s0 block is processed before jumping
to the enclosing block or returning to the caller.
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH this %] 
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH that %] 
\&       ...
\&    [% FINAL %]
\&       All done!
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
The output from the \s-1TRY\s0 block is left intact up to the point where an
exception occurs.  For example, this template:
.Sp

Exception types are hierarchical, with each level being separated by
the familiar dot operator.  A '\s-1DBI\s0.connect' exception is a more
specific kind of '\s-1DBI\s0' error.  Similarly, a 'myown.error.barf' is a
more specific kind of 'myown.error' type which itself is also a
\&'myown' error.  A \s-1CATCH\s0 handler that specifies a general exception
type (such as '\s-1DBI\s0' or 'myown.error') will also catch more specific
types that have the same prefix as long as a more specific handler
isn't defined.  Note that the order in which \s-1CATCH\s0 handlers are
defined is irrelevant; a more specific handler will always catch an
exception in preference to a more generic or default one.
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH DBI ;
\&         INCLUDE database/error.html ;
\&       CATCH DBI.connect ;
\&         INCLUDE database/connect.html ;
\&       CATCH ; 
\&         INCLUDE error.html ;
\&       END
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
In this example, a '\s-1DBI\s0.connect' error has it's own handler, a more
general '\s-1DBI\s0' block is used for all other \s-1DBI\s0 or \s-1DBI\s0.* errors and a 
default handler catches everything else.
.Sp
Exceptions can be raised in a template using the \s-1THROW\s0 directive.  The
first parameter is the exception type which doesn't need to be quoted
(but can be, it's the same as \s-1INCLUDE\s0) followed by the relevant error
message which can be any regular value such as a quoted string,
variable, etc.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% THROW food "Missing ingredients: $recipe.error" %]
\&
\&    [% THROW user.login 'no user id: please login' %]
\&
\&    [% THROW $myerror.type "My Error: $myerror.info" %]
.Ve
.Sp
It's also possible to specify additional positional or named 
parameters to the \s-1THROW\s0 directive if you want to pass more than 
just a simple message back as the error info field.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% THROW food 'eggs' 'flour' msg='Missing Ingredients' %]
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, the error 'info' field will be a hash array containing
the named arguments, in this case 'msg' => 'Missing Ingredients',
and an 'args' item which contains a list of the positional arguments, 
in this case 'eggs' and 'flour'.  The error 'type' field remains 
unchanged, here set to 'food'.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    [% CATCH food %]
\&       [% error.info.msg %]
\&       [% FOREACH item = error.info.args %]
\&          * [% item %]
\&       [% END %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
This produces the output:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&       Missing Ingredients
\&         * eggs
\&         * flour
.Ve
.Sp
In addition to specifying individual positional arguments as
[% error.info.args.n %], the 'info' hash contains keys directly 
pointing to the positional arguments, as a convenient shortcut.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% error.info.0 %]   # same as [% error.info.args.0 %]
.Ve
.Sp
Exceptions can also be thrown from Perl code which you've bound to
template variables, or defined as a plugin or other extension.  To
raise an exception, call \fIdie()\fR passing a reference to a
Template::Exception object as the argument.  This will then be caught
by any enclosing \s-1TRY\s0 blocks from where the code was called.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use Template::Exception;
\&    ...
\&
\&    my $vars = {
\&        foo => sub {
\&            # ... do something ...
\&            die Template::Exception\->new('myerr.naughty',
\&                                         'Bad, bad error');
\&        },
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
template:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&       [% foo %]
\&       ...   
\&    [% CATCH myerr ;
\&         "Error: $error" ;
\&       END
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Error: myerr.naughty error \- Bad, bad error
.Ve
.Sp
The 'info' field can also be a reference to another object or data
structure, if required.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    die Template::Exception\->new('myerror', { 
\&        module => 'foo.pl', 
\&        errors => [ 'bad permissions', 'naughty boy' ],
\&    });
.Ve
.Sp
Later, in a template:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       ...
\&    [% CATCH myerror %]
\&       [% error.info.errors.size or 'no';
\&          error.info.errors.size == 1 ? ' error' : ' errors' %]
\&       in [% error.info.module %]: 
\&          [% error.info.errors.join(', ') %].
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
Generating the output:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&       2 errors in foo.pl:
\&          bad permissions, naughty boy.
.Ve
.Sp
You can also call \fIdie()\fR with a single string, as is common in much 
existing Perl code.  This will automatically be converted to an 
exception of the 'undef' type (that's the literal string 'undef', 
not the undefined value).  If the string isn't terminated with a 
newline then Perl will append the familiar \*(L" at \f(CW$file\fR line \f(CW$line\fR\*(R"
message.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    sub foo {
\&        # ... do something ...
\&        die "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If you're writing a plugin, or some extension code that has the
current Template::Context in scope (you can safely skip this section
if this means nothing to you) then you can also raise an exception by
calling the context \fIthrow()\fR method.  You can pass it an
Template::Exception object reference, a pair of ($type, \f(CW$info\fR) parameters
or just an \f(CW$info\fR string to create an exception of 'undef' type.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $context\->throw($e);            # exception object
\&    $context\->throw('Denied');      # 'undef' type
\&    $context\->throw('user.passwd', 'Bad Password');
.Ve
.IP "\s-1NEXT\s0" 4
.IX Item "NEXT"
The \s-1NEXT\s0 directive can be used to start the next iteration of a \s-1FOREACH\s0 
or \s-1WHILE\s0 loop.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% FOREACH user = userlist %]
\&       [% NEXT IF user.isguest %]
\&       Name: [% user.name %]    Email: [% user.email %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.IP "\s-1LAST\s0" 4
.IX Item "LAST"
The \s-1LAST\s0 directive can be used to prematurely exit a \s-1FOREACH\s0 or \s-1WHILE\s0
loop.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% FOREACH user = userlist %]
\&       Name: [% user.name %]    Email: [% user.email %]
\&       [% LAST IF some.condition %]
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1BREAK\s0 can also be used as an alias for \s-1LAST\s0.
.IP "\s-1RETURN\s0" 4
.IX Item "RETURN"
The \s-1RETURN\s0 directive can be used to stop processing the current
template and return to the template from which it was called, resuming
processing at the point immediately after the \s-1INCLUDE\s0, \s-1PROCESS\s0 or
\&\s-1WRAPPER\s0 directive.  If there is no enclosing template then the
Template \fIprocess()\fR method will return to the calling code with a 
true value.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    Before
\&    [% INCLUDE half_wit %]
\&    After
\&  
\&    [% BLOCK half_wit %]
\&    This is just half...
\&    [% RETURN %]

\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sp
output:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    Before
\&    This is just half...
\&    After
.Ve
.IP "\s-1STOP\s0" 4
.IX Item "STOP"
The \s-1STOP\s0 directive can be used to indicate that the processor should
stop gracefully without processing any more of the template document.
This is a planned stop and the Template \fIprocess()\fR method will return a
\&\fBtrue\fR value to the caller.  This indicates that the template was
processed successfully according to the directives within it.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% IF something.terrible.happened %]
\&       [% INCLUDE fatal/error.html %]
\&       [% STOP %]
\&    [% END %]

.Ve
.IP "\s-1CLEAR\s0" 4
.IX Item "CLEAR"
The \s-1CLEAR\s0 directive can be used to clear the output buffer for the current
enclosing block.   It is most commonly used to clear the output generated
from a \s-1TRY\s0 block up to the point where the error occurred.
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    [% TRY %]
\&       blah blah blah            # this is normally left intact
\&       [% THROW some 'error' %]  # up to the point of error

\&    [% CATCH %]
\&       [% CLEAR %]               # clear the TRY output
\&       [% error %]               # print error string
\&    [% END %]
.Ve
.Sh "Miscellaneous"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous"
.IP "\s-1META\s0" 4
.IX Item "META"
The \s-1META\s0 directive allows simple metadata items to be defined within a 
template.  These are evaluated when the template is parsed and as such
may only contain simple values (e.g. it's not possible to interpolate 
other variables values into \s-1META\s0 variables).
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    [% META
\&       title   = 'The Cat in the Hat'
\&       author  = 'Dr. Seuss'
\&       version = 1.23 
\&    %]
.Ve
.Sp
The 'template' variable contains a reference to the main template 
being processed.  These metadata items may be retrieved as attributes
of the template.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <h1>[% template.title %]</h1>
\&    <h2>[% template.author %]</h2>
.Ve
.Sp
The 'name' and 'modtime' metadata items are automatically defined for
each template to contain its name and modification time in seconds
since the epoch.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% USE date %]              # use Date plugin to format time
\&    ...
\&    [% template.name %] last modified
\&    at [% date.format(template.modtime) %]
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1PRE_PROCESS\s0 and \s-1POST_PROCESS\s0 options allow common headers and 
footers to be added to all templates.  The 'template' reference is
correctly defined when these templates are processed, allowing headers
and footers to reference metadata items from the main template.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $template = Template\->new({
\&        PRE_PROCESS  => 'header',
\&        POST_PROCESS => 'footer',
\&    });

.IP "\s-1TAGS\s0" 4
.IX Item "TAGS"
The \s-1TAGS\s0 directive can be used to set the \s-1START_TAG\s0 and \s-1END_TAG\s0 values
on a per-template file basis.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    [% TAGS <+ +> %]
\&

The \s-1TAGS\s0 directive may also be used to set a named \s-1TAG_STYLE\s0
.Sp
.Vb 2

.Ve
.Sp
See the \s-1TAGS\s0 and \s-1TAG_STYLE\s0 configuration options for further details.
.IP "\s-1DEBUG\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEBUG"
The \s-1DEBUG\s0 directive can be used to enable or disable directive debug
messages within a template.  The \s-1DEBUG\s0 configuration option must be
set to include \s-1DEBUG_DIRS\s0 for the \s-1DEBUG\s0 directives to have any effect.
If \s-1DEBUG_DIRS\s0 is not set then the parser will automatically ignore and
remove any \s-1DEBUG\s0 directives.
.Sp
The \s-1DEBUG\s0 directive can be used with an 'on' or 'off' parameter to
enable or disable directive debugging messages from that point
forward.  When enabled, the output of each directive in the generated
output will be prefixed by a comment indicate the file, line and
original directive text.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    [% DEBUG on %]
\&    directive debugging is on (assuming DEBUG option is set true)
\&    [% DEBUG off %]
