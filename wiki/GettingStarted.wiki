        * Binary packages are available for most platforms (Windows, Linux, OS X, etc.).

  * A text editor
        * [http://www.vim.org/download.php Vim] - FOSS - POSIX/Mac OS X/Windows
        * [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs] - FOSS - POSIX/Mac OS X/Windows

Aditionally, you will need Google Code credentials (username/[http://code.google.com/hosting/settings password]). Contact one of the Project owners to join the group. Note: even if your Google Code username is identical to your Gmail address, your Google Code password will always be different from your Gmail password.

= Obtain the project source code =

After you have subversion, you can checkout the source code.

With the `svn` command line client, type the following:
{{{
svn checkout https://atlanta-pm-code.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ atlanta-pm-code --username YourGoogleCodeUsername
}}}

With GUI clients, you should be able to checkout the source code by providing the subversion URL (https://atlanta-pm-code.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/) and your Google Code credentials (username/[http://code.google.com/hosting/settings password]).

= Overview of Test Coverage =

http://search.cpan.org/~pjcj/Devel-Cover-0.64/lib/Devel/Cover/Tutorial.pod

Nitty gritty: install Devel::Cover via cpan, toggle switches, or other method of your choosing; type "cover -test" in directory with code base (parent of "t"); stand back
