= Obtaining the source code =
After you have subversion, you can check out the source code.

For command line clients, type the following:
   svn checkout https://atlanta-pm-code.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ atlanta-pm-code --username bobsmith
        Replace bobsmith with your Google code username (XXXXXX@example.com)
        This command will ask for a password.  This is not the password you login to gmail with.  You can obtain your GoogleCode password by going to (http://code.google.com/hosting/settings).

For GUI clients, you should be able to do a checkout and provide the subversion URL (https://atlanta-pm-code.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/) and your Google Code username/password as specified above.
