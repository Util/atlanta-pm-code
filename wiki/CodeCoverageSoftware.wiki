#summary Getting up and running with test coverage

= Introduction =

There are some CPAN modules that are used to determine the test coverage for a source program.

= Details =

After you have checked out the source (see GettingStarted), you need to install some CPAN modules.  Change into the testing_tools sub directory.  The most up to date instructions are located in README in that directory.

= Installing Perl Modules =
CPAN is a internet repository of Perl Modules that are available for installation.  To install a given module, download and extract the tarball.  Cd into the extracted source and run the following commands:

  * perl Makefile.PL
      * Checks for any pre-requisites and generates a Makefile for you.
  * make
      * Compiles the source code (if required), creates Perl module files, POD documentation, etc
  * make test
      * Runs the tests that are included with the perl module to test/verify your compilation
  * [sudo] make install
      * Installs the perl module in the standard module directory so that your perl programs can find those modules.  Sudo is required if you are not running make install as root.
